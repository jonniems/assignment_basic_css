    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Let me quickly introduce myself. I'm Jonnie, 37 years old and starting a front-end development course at Winc
      Academy. Previously I worked at various companies in ecommerce as Category Manager, Business Development Manager
      and
      Project Manager. Now it's time to do learn about the most interesting part of the world wide web, actually
      developing websites.</p>
    <p>I live together with my wife and two cats in Amsterdam and am currently renovating my apartment. My hobbies are
      going out for a fancy dinner and sports like cycling and football.</p>
